# Introduction

This is a skeleton application using the Hyperf framework. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those looking to get their feet wet with Hyperf Framework.

# Getting started

Once installed, you can run the server immediately using the command below.

```bash

make dev
make setup
```

Or if in a Docker based environment you can use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` provided by the template:

```bash
make dev
```

This will start the cli-server on port `9501`, and bind it to all network interfaces. You can then visit the site at `http://localhost/` which will bring up Hyperf default home page.
